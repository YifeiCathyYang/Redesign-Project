## üéØ Goal  
This project aims to **redesign a global heat stress risk visualization** to improve clarity, interactivity, and ethical data representation. Key objectives include:  
- Enhancing visual encoding (color, size, labels) for better temperature trend visibility.  
- Integrating dynamic interaction (time slider, tooltips) to explore temporal climate patterns.  
- Addressing weaknesses in the original visualization, such as missing legends, opaque risk calculations, and static data representation.  


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used  
- **Python Libraries**: `Plotly` (for interactive maps and charts), `Pandas` (data processing).  
- **Platform**: Google Colab (cloud-based notebook environment).  
- **Data Source**: [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data).  


## üìä Data Visualization Theory  
The redesign is grounded in **Tamara Munzner's Visualization Framework** and **data governance principles**:  

### **Munzner's Key Principles**  
1. **Encoding Principles**:  
   - Color gradients and marker sizes encode temperature values intuitively.  
   - Geographic labels (e.g., US, China) highlight high-impact regions.  
2. **Task Abstraction**: Supports user goals like "discover trends" and "present insights."  
3. **Idiom Validation**: Improved usability through interactive elements (e.g., time slider).  
4. **Dynamic Data**: Replaced static maps with time-based interaction for evolving climate risk.  

### **Data Governance Frameworks**  
- **FAIR Principles**: Dataset transparency, accessibility, and reusability.  
- **OECD Guidelines**: Clear annotations ensure data traceability.  
- **DMBOK Standards**: Avoided misleading visuals through standardized encoding.  


## üìà Results  
### Redesigned Visualizations  
1. **Interactive Global Temperature Map**  
   - **Features**: Time slider, tooltips, continent/country labels.  
   - **Improvements**:  
     - Intuitive color scale and size encoding for temperature trends.  
     - Highlighted key regions (e.g., China, US, India).  

2. **Global Surface Temperature Trends Over Time**  
   - **Features**: Animated line chart with temporal granularity.  
   - **Improvements**: Clear visualization of long-term warming patterns.  

3. **Temperature Variability Map (Mean vs. Max)**  
   - **Features**: Dual encoding for comparative analysis.  

### Key Advantages Over Original  
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Clarity**: Eliminated overplotting with spatial grouping.  
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Exploration**: Time slider enables tracking changes across decades.  
- ‚úÖ **Ethical Transparency**: Cited data sources and methodology openly.
